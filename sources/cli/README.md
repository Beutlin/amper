This is Amper's own entry point. 
In development (under Amper checkout) you may use `amper` script to build projects

e.g. under `examples/jvm-hello-world`
```../../prototype-implementation/cli/scripts/amper --from-sources```

You may compile Amper project as well: under `prototype-implementation`
```./cli/scripts/amper --from-sources assemble```
